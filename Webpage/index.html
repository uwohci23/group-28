          <p>Our newly redesigned 2D racing game aims to deliver an engaging, immersive, and user-friendly gaming
            experience. We have re-designed the previous basic web-based car game, which had limited features, with a
            more comprehensive and interactive game that caters to different players' preferences and styles.
            <br>
            <br>
            Our design process focused on redesigning the previous game with the user in mind, adhering to over 20
            design principles, including principles related to usability, accessibility, and visual design. We have also
            conducted a heuristic evaluation of the system using a set of heuristics med at improving usability and user
            experience.
            In the following sections, we will provide a navigational map of the system, a detailed list of the design
            principles we used, a final analytical (heuristic) evaluation of the system, and our recommendations for how
            the system can be improved.
            <br>
            <br>
            <b>Key features:</b>
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="summary-features">
          <p><b>Improved User Experience</b>: The new game offers a number of options that allow players to customise
            and immerse themselves in the experience, such as controlling in-game music and sound effects,
            enabling/disabling animations, changing resolution, and muting volume.</p>
          <p><b>Interesting Maps</b>: With ten different maps, players can choose from a range of racing settings, which
            keeps the gameplay interesting and fun.</p>
          <p><b>Diverse Vehicle Options</b>: Players have a choice of five different vehicle types, each with their own
            special features, making for a more individualised and interesting driving experience.</p>
          <p><b>Customizable Enemy Cars</b>: Players can choose the quantity, kind, and colour of enemy cars in the
            game, which adds another level of strategy and difficulty.</p>
          <p><b>Single and Dual Player Modes</b> For more excitement, players can play the game in single-player mode or
            in dual-player mode with a buddy.</p>
          <p>Users have the opportunity to select their starting positions, which gives the game play an additional
            layer of strategy.</p>
          <p><b>Multiplayer Customization</b> For a distinctive and competitive gaming experience in multiplayer mode,
            players can choose their starting places and modify their cars.</p>
          <p><b>In-Game Mechanics</b>: The game shows player rankings and vehicle damage while it is being played,
            giving players important feedback and increasing their level of involvement.</p>
          <p><b>Realistic Damage System</b>: The game's damage is not just superficial; it also impacts how well the
            cars perform, which gives the gameplay an extra depth of realism and strategy.</p>
          <p><b>Power-ups</b>: Players can choose from four different kinds of power-ups to improve their gaming
            experience and add an extra layer of strategy.</p>
          <p><b>Control Options</b>: Players have the option of using the arrow keys or the WASD keys to operate the
            game, depending on their preferences.</p>
          <p><b>Redesigned Dashboard and UI</b>: The game's dashboard and user interface have been updated to provide a
            more aesthetically pleasing and user-friendly experience.</p>
          <p><b>Consistent Animations</b>: The use of appropriate animations has made for a smoother and more pleasant
            gaming experience.</p>
          <p><b>Consistent Animations</b>: The use of appropriate animations makes for a better and more pleasurable
            gaming experience.</p>
          <p><b>Player rankings at the conclusion of each race</b>: This feature adds a competitive aspect and enables
            players to monitor their advancement.</p>
          <p><b>Resolution Flexibility</b>: By giving players with older devices the opportunity to change the window
            resolution, the game is made available to a larger audience.</p>

              <p>The game's redesigned dashboard and user interface (UI) are aesthetically appealing and easy to use
                thanks to consistent
                design patterns. Users can now explore and engage with the game more quickly thanks to this improvement.
                To avoid
                confusing players, the game's design maintains both internal and external consistency. In order to
                maintain internal
                consistency, the backgrounds and buttons are all of a similar design, with the blue background and
                orange buttons
                creating a pleasing contrast to enhance the visuals. Because these games typically take either WSAD or
                arrow keys as a
                method of control, we adopted them for high external consistency. Players can choose either method as
                they please
                without having to pick up any new skills.
                Also, buttons are named properly. ‘Back’ button means going to the previous page, while the ‘Quit’
                button indicates
                quitting or exiting the game.</p>

          to while racing, personalising and improving the gameplay experience.</div>

        <div class="myDIV">3. Adding option for enabling gameplay via controllers:</div>
        <div class="hide">Accessibility can be increased by providing support for a variety of gameplay controllers,
          such as Xbox and PlayStation
          controllers. Giving players the choice to use controllers instead of keyboard controls can make gameplay more
          welcoming
          and comfortable for all players. Additionally, the game
          ought to have a controller mapping function that enables users to alter the button layout to suit their
          tastes.</div>

        <div class="myDIV">4. More advanced settings options</div>
        <div class="hide">Increasing the number of settings choices can better accommodate various player preferences
          and hardware setups. This
          may entail including advanced graphics options that enable players with various hardware configurations to
          optimize the
          efficiency of the game, such as texture quality, anti-aliasing, and shadow detail. Other advanced settings
          might enable
          players to reassign keys to their preferred layout and change the camera angle or field of view while playing,
          resulting
          in a more individualized experience.</div>
